      We can explore how these values correlate with one another, allowing us to see the outliers and nuance in our dataset. In the following plot you can explore the occupations with the highest proportions of green skills but in the highest polluting industries (top right), and the least proportion of green skills but in the least polluting industries (bottom left).

      In the next plot we dig into industries, where each point represents an industry rather than occupation. In this, we can explore how the average time spent on green tasks compares to the average proportion of green skills.

  <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-8">The regional picture</h2>

  <div class="w-full mb-4 pr-0 md:pr-8">
      Our job adverts come from all over the UK, so by averaging our green measures for each region we can compare greenness regionally. In the following plots you can select a type of measure to compare (average proportion of green skills, average time spent on green tasks or average GHG emissions). You can also change the maps to break down the UK into different granularities - we use <%= link_to 'ITL regions', 'https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/ukgeographies/eurostat', class: 'link', target: '_blank', rel: 'noopener' %> for this.

      <p>Not all skills in green occupations are considered green. Some of these skills will be transversal - for example communication skills are found across the majority of job adverts regardless of how green the job is. However, some of these skills may be new green skills which werenâ€™t given in the green skill list we search through. To investigate these complimentary skills, we looked at the skills that commonly co-occurred with green skills in the job adverts from green occupations. The plot below shows these.</p>
