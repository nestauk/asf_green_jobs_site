  <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">About this tool</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">
    At Nesta, we're measuring the greenness of every job advert to help facilitate the transition of the UK workforce to net zero. Central to this research is our ever-growing database of almost 8 million online job postings, collected since 2021.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    To generate rich and novel data about green jobs, we extract information about skills, occupation and industry from job adverts. Once this information is extracted, we match it to existing datasets that tell us how green a given skill, occupation or industry is.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    For example, a job advert may have a high proportion of skills that are found within validated green skill lists; the occupation the job advert is advertising for may have a high green timeshare (based on validated green task definitions); and the industry the role is advertised in may have low greenhouse gas emissions per employee.
  </p>
  <p>
    To make the data on these measures for our millions of job adverts more digestible, this tool aggregates and averages the data per standardised occupation and region. This allows us to give each occupation three green ratings, depending on: the skills required for that occupation, whether the occupation itself is considered green, and the industry the occupation most commonly appears in. We also aggregate these measures to produce a measure of "overall greenness".
